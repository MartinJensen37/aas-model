"""DMP-extended AssetInterfacesMappingConfiguration — extensions over the
generated IDTA AIMC.

Layering (DMP v3): the generated IDTA template
(``aas_pydantic.submodel_templates.asset_interfaces_mapping_configuration``)
stays PRISTINE — the DMP extension lives HERE. A plain IDTA AIMC (Sources,
Sinks, Transformation, DefaultPollingInterval) remains a valid DMP input for
data mappings; every addition is optional and carries a semantic id in this
project's namespace (``constants.AIMC_*``).

An operation mapping (its Sources address its individual AAS Operation
variables, ADR-022) invokes one action affordance whose terminal reply is its
result (OPC UA Method, MQTT 5 request/reply on the correlation data, HTTP):

1. **command** — the IDTA ``Transformation`` turns the caller's variables into
   the command; the IDTA ``Sinks`` address the action;
2. **response** — ``ResponseSources`` select the action's output or members
   of it, the ``ResponseTransformation`` maps them, and ``ResponseSinks``
   route each result to an explicit Operation output or InOut variable; other
   sinks are written best effort. The three are authored together. An Operation
   with output or InOut variables needs them; nothing is matched by name.
   Without them the Operation answers with no outputs (an invoke-only action
   such as Halt).

Multi-step device sequences (set parameters, trigger, poll a status, read a
result, reset) are not modelled here; the higher-level control orchestrates
them through ordinary mappings.
