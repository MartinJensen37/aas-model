Variables submodel — Pydantic model for asset variable definitions.

The Variables submodel contains named variable definitions. Each variable
carries its ontology concept as a supplemental semantic id on the
``variable`` Property, whose VALUE is the live data the AIMC mappings sink
into.

This is a custom (non-IDTA) submodel until an IDTA Variables template
is standardized. It follows the same structural pattern as generated
aas_pydantic templates.

Structure::

    Variables
    └── variable[]                (VariableProp — a plain Property, OR
                                   VariableItem — a group of them)

A variable is a **plain Property** by default: the value itself is the live
data the AIMC mappings sink into, addressed directly as
``Variables/<name>``. Nest it in a ``VariableItem`` only when the variable
genuinely groups several children (e.g. a structured reading), in which case
the group is an SMC addressed as ``Variables/<name>``.

Both forms live in the same ``variable`` map, so a submodel can mix them::

    Variables
    ├── PackMLState              (Property)
    └── Grouped                  (SMC)
        └── variable             (Property)

Time series live in the groups ``State`` (discrete status), ``Measurements``
(continuous values) and ``Log`` (what is logged explicitly). A group holds
TimeSeries SMCs (``time_series``), or plain elements for data that is not a
time series. The flat ``variable`` map remains until the stations' mappings
target LinkedSegments (aas-camel-dmp PLAN, item 2).
